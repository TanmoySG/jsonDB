# wunderDB v2

Hi! Welcome to the wunderDB Repository. 

Currently I am rewriting the whole project in Golang with standard API following development practices. So this branch is still a Work in Progress! 👷🏻 🏗️ Hope to deliver the initial version of v2 soon! 

## WDB-Retro

The first version, based on Python Flask will not be phased out any time soon. To keep it accessible and so that the version 1 doesn't get lost in the version list, I have moved the v1 to a new repository here - [wdb-retro](https://github.com/TanmoySG/wdb-retro). 

This repo has all the version 1 code as well as the Docker Image with a new name -so that when I publish the wunderDB v2 Docker Images are published the v1 Image doesnt get lost and anyone planning to use that still can. The version 1 will not be actively maintained. 

Check out the final release of v1 <https://github.com/TanmoySG/wdb-retro/releases/tag/v1.1.0>
